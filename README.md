This is a mobile app (not published to the Google Play Store) that can be installed onto an Android phone with the purpose of creating grocery lists stored locally on the users's phone instead of reyling on Kroger/King Soopers.

## Features
The bare minimum of the features of the Kroger/King Soopers app are available to the user. This includes:
* Searching for products by terms
* Adding products to a list
* Updating quantities of product within the list
* Checking items off the list when purchased
* Clearing checked items off the list

## Settings
The application is designed to be ran with a simple Go backend server. To that end, there is a settings button on the home screen where the user can supply the URL of their backend server. Something like `192.168.1.20`

## Installing
The application can be installed by enabling developer mode in Android Studio and pairing the phone to the computer which is running the code. Then just build and run the application and it'll be installed on the paired android phone.
